			<p>Hello! I'm Gianni Gambetti and this is my website. The information on this page may or may not be the most up to date, but it was updated <abbr class="timeago" title="{{site.lastupdate}}">on {{ site.lastupdate }}</abbr>. If for whatever reason you need something that's more up to date, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact/">send me a message</a>.

			<!-- The abbr tag will be replaced with text that will always end in "ago" -->
			As quickly as possible, this is who I am:
			<blockquote>
				Gianni Gambetti is a software developer, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/resume#education">student</a>, geek, anthropomorphiser of computers and privacy enthusiast.
			</blockquote>
			And here are all the details:
			<blockquote>
				Gianni Gambetti is a software developer, that prefers to work with back end systems and has a strong interest in security and distributed systems. He's also currently studying for a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/resume#uw">Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo</a>, which he is currently calling home. Every four months he likes a change of pace and switches between studying and doing an internship through the co-op program at UWaterloo. He's a self proclaimed geek, who enjoys playing tabletop RPGs, as well as reading science fiction and fantasy novels.
