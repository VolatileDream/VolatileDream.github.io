	As quickly as possible, this is who I am:
	<blockquote>
		Gianni Gambetti is a software developer, geek, anthropomorphiser of computers, and privacy/security enthusiast.
	</blockquote>
	And here are all the details:
	<blockquote>
		Gianni Gambetti is a software developer, working on the proto-"Internet of Things" (aka Android), and interested in the privacy/security implications of interconnected devices.
		He has a <a href="/resume#uw">Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo</a>, where he had brief tenure as the <a href="/resume#uw">President of the Computer Science Club</a>.
		He's a self proclaimed geek, who enjoys reading science fiction and fantasy novels.
           And he can sometimes be found playing tabletop Role Playing Games (RPGs), or rolling dice for other forms of board games.
