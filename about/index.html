  A short professional bio:

	And the whole story:
	<blockquote>

    They got their start in software with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Battle">Robot Battle</a> and <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">Auto Hotkey</a> scripting.
		From there they went and got a <a href="/resume#uw">Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo</a>, where they were briefly the <a href="/resume#uw">President of the Computer Science Club</a>.
    After spending almost six years at <a href="/resume#google2">Alphabet (Google)</a>, they're now working for <a href="/resume#hashicorp">Hashicorp</a> on Terraform Cloud.
    In their spare time (when not engrossed in reading) they can be found fiddling with software to grow their homelab, or be found playing all manner of table top and board games.
