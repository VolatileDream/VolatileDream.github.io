			<p>Hello! I'm Gianni Gambetti and this is my website. The information on this page may or may not be the most up to date, but it was updated <abbr class="timeago" title="{{site.lastupdate}}">on {{ site.lastupdate}}</abbr>.

			As quickly as possible, this is who I am:
			<blockquote>
				Gianni Gambetti is a software developer, student, geek, anthropomorphiser of computers and privacy enthusiast.
			</blockquote>
			And here are all the details:
			<blockquote>
				Gianni Gambetti is a software developer, that prefers to work with back end systems and has a strong interest in artificial intelligence and distributed systems. He's also currently studying for a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, which he is currently calling home. Every four months he likes a change of pace and switches between studying and doing an internship through the Co-op program at UWaterloo. He's a self proclaimed geek, who enjoys playing tabletop RPGs, as well as reading science fiction and fantasy novels.
