On May 5th I started taking the [Real-time Programming course][3] offered at the University of Waterloo. It's a course 


### What is 'real-time'?

[Wikipedia][1] categorizes real-time programs by the usefulness of an answer after the deadline to compute it:

* Hard: not having an answer by it's deadline is deemed system failure
* Soft: not having an answer degrades the quality of the service

An example of a hard real-time system would be a [cardiac pacemaker][4] which must compute the beat at which to deliver electric shocks to the heart, or if it should be delivering a shock at all. In contrast, soft real-time would be something like audio or video decoding.
