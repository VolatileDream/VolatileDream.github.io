On May 5th I started taking the [Real-time Programming course][3] offered at the University of Waterloo. It's a course 


### What is 'real-time'?

[Wikipedia][1] categorizes real-time programs by the usefulness of an answer after the deadline to compute it:

* Hard: not having an answer by a deadline is deemed system failure
* Soft: not having an answer degrades the quality of the service

An example of a hard real-time system would be a [cardiac pacemaker][4] which must compute the time at which to deliver electric shocks to the heart, or if it should be delivering a shock at all. In contrast, soft real-time would be something like audio or video decoding.


### Rumors about the course


In Real-Time, you get to play with trains all day. In all seriousness, Real-time is considered the hardest computer science course at the University, with [Graphics][5] and [Compilers][6] coming in second and third respectively. Students are typically heard disucussing the amount of time they spend in the lab, during the very short amount of time they spend outside of the lab. While the course bears no warning about the amount of time it takes to complete the lab work, students appear to have a tendency to spend all of their time in the lab working on it - it becomes as time consuming as a full time job.


### Taking Real-Time

While taking real-time you write a [micro-kernel][7], various applications that implement a Clock, Serial IO, and maybe even a micro-[Shell][8]. This is the first two thirds (2/3) of the course. The last third of the course is spent measuring the acceleration and speed profiles of the trains, and implementing software to move and route the trains around in the track without running into each other. And should you have any extra time, you get to implement a project of your choosing - as long as it runs on top of the trains application you've written.


If there are only two things to say about the course, they are:

* It is a wonderful learning experience.
* [All Aboard The Crazy Train!][11]
